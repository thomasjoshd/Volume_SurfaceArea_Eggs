# Volume_SurfaceArea_Eggs
A code to produce a volume and surface area estimate on a 2D image of an egg assuming cylindrical symmetry.


You just need to download and run VolumeArea.py.  Works best with python 3.  Requires the following libraries:
cv2 (openCV),
numpy,
mpatplotlib.


This code also uses code by Ben Hammel, which has been included in the VolumeArea.py file so that its a stand-alone execution from the python commandline.
